# Attendence-using-localstorage
This will helps for new explorers who exploring throw web development and full stack development, specially who still didn't touch back-end or database tools.
This project is a simple web-based Login and Attendance Management System built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with data storage handled entirely through the browser's LocalStorage.
It includes four core pages: `index.html` for user registration via a login form with fields like name, email, password, domain, education, Aadhaar number, and entry time; `signup.html` for validating login credentials; `welcome.html` that provides navigation to student and attendance views; and `display.html` which manages and displays student records, attendance selection (1st gate), and final submission (2nd gate).
The system supports filtering out duplicate entries before attendance is taken, and after the 2nd gate, it only displays the final list of selected original entries, ensuring clean data handling. 
This project is ideal for learning form validation, LocalStorage manipulation, and client-side state management without any backend dependencies. 
It runs directly in the browser and serves as a beginner-friendly prototype for user and attendance management systems.
